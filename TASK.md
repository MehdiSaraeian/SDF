# Project Tasks

## April 8, 2025

- [x] **CurveSDF.py**: Refactor NURBS curve generation to use the `geomdl` library.
- [x] **CurveSDF.py**: Rewrite the code to use curve.evaluate() instead of the curve(t) function.
- [x] **CurveSDF.py**: Make the 3D plot interactive and visualize iso-surfaces of the SDF.
